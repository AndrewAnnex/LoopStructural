LoopStructural
==============
Loop structural is an open source 3D modelling library written by Lachlan Grose at Monash University. The library is
the forward geological modelling engine for the loop and contains the classes and functions to manage the various
elements in a 3D geological model. Including stratigraphy, unconformities, fault and folds. LoopStructural contains
three native interpolation algorithms that use a discrete implicit approach as well as a wrapper for using the
generalised radial basis functions provided by Surfe.
