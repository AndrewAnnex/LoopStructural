        **Installing a precompiled version**

    LoopStructural is compiled and uploaded onto the releases page on the LoopStructural github. You need to install
    the relevant version of LoopStructural for your distribution and python version. For example to install LoopStructural
    for Windows 64 bit using python 3.6 you would download the package `LoopStructural-0.0.0-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl <https://github.com/Loop3D/LoopStructural/releases/download/latest/LoopStructural-0.0.0-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl>`_.

    LoopStructural can then be installed into your python environment by running the command within your chosen python virtual environment.
    .. code-block::

        pip install LoopStructural-0.0.0-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl

.. container:: toggle

    .. container:: header

        If you want to install LoopStructural from source to be able to modify the code you will need to have a working C++ compiler.
