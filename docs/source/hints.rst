Controlling interpolation norm
==============================

When building a scalar field often the distance between isosurfaces is something that might be important to control. This can be controlled with two approaches
1. Controlling the magnitude of the norm of the scalar field by specifying the normal vector.
2. Specifying two value control points of different values.
