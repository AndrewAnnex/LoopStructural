Piecewise Linear Interpolator
=============================

One of the interpolation algorithms provided by LoopStructural is the piecewise
linear interpolator. This algorithm approximates the implicit function
using a piecewise linear tetrahedral mesh. The function is found by
minimising constraints in the least squares sense.
