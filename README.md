Loop3D Geological Forward Modeling Engine.

* Python/cython implementation of a piecewise linear interpolation (Discrete Smooth Interpolator in Gocad) 
* Fold interpolation using constraints outlined in Laurent 2016 with fold geostatistical tools shown in Grose et al., 2017
* Fault interpolation 

If you want to use LoopStructural the easiest way to get started is to use a docker container and a jupyter notebook environment.
